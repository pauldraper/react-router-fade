# React Router Fade

[Demo](https://pauldraper.github.io/react-router-fade/)

Demo of fading routes with React Router.

Uses `CSSTransition` from
[React Transition Group](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/),
but replaces `TransitionGroup` with an alternative implementation.

See [src/transition.jsx](src/transition.jsx).
